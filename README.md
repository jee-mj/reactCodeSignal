# CodeSignal 🧔‍♂️📖 Drills

## Background

I sat there hating on JavaScript due to nightmare flashbacks of when I had to clean-install my PC, and `node_modules` broke my backup, and my tiny mind at the time could only fathom a clean wipe, and so I did exactly that, and stopped coding for almost 3 years! After booting into a clean-install of Windows 10, I decided it was too much trouble to code.

Yes, I have JavaScript and React to thank for helping me make a really dumb decision but anyway! Let's give them another chance because [I solved that forsaken problem here](https://github.com/jee-mj/bin-node-obj-cleaner). I also don't feel bad about looking stupid on GitHub anymore.

### FTL

The motive is to just zoom through the course, which should be easier in JS than in [Python](https://github.com/jee-mj/pythonCodeSignal).

## Thanks, Petersham!

I really wouldn't be here without TAFENSW, Petersham. So I want to give them a shout out and thank them for all the hard work they put into me, confirming my front-end affinity and also teaching me advanced usage of React!

## Then why the course?

This course is pivotal for me to feel more comfortable with React. During that course, I had freedom of implementation. So I implemented a solution written completely in .NET, because that was beautiful and elegant for me. I originally learned about .NET a very very long time ago, and it has only become more respectable in recent times.

## Then why JavaScript?
